## Preparing Your First Speech

Your Ice Breaker speech is an exciting milestone—it's your first opportunity to address the club and introduce yourself. Here's how to prepare for success.

### Understanding the Ice Breaker

The Ice Breaker is typically 4-6 minutes long and is designed to be simple. The goal is to:

- Introduce yourself to the club
- Share something about your background, interests, or goals
- Get comfortable speaking in front of the group

### Preparation Tips

**1. Choose Your Content**

Pick 2-3 key points about yourself. Consider:
- Your background or career
- Hobbies and interests
- Why you joined Toastmasters
- Personal goals or aspirations

**2. Structure Your Speech**

Use a simple structure:
- **Opening**: Grab attention with a question, story, or interesting fact
- **Body**: Develop your 2-3 main points
- **Closing**: End with a memorable conclusion

**3. Practice, But Don't Over-Rehearse**

- Practice your speech several times
- Time yourself to stay within the limit
- Practice in front of a mirror or record yourself
- Avoid memorizing word-for-word—speak naturally

### On the Day

- Arrive early and settle in
- Take deep breaths to calm any nerves
- Remember: everyone in the room has given their Ice Breaker and understands how you feel
- Focus on connecting with your audience, not perfection

### After Your Speech

You'll receive an evaluation that highlights what you did well and offers suggestions for improvement. This feedback is invaluable for your growth as a speaker.
